Love deeply but tell no one
Do adventures things but tell no one
Pursue your dreams but tell no one
Live happily but tell no one
Make new habits but tell no one
Be kind but tell no one
Excel but tell no one
Do crazy stuff but tell no one
Have secrets but tell no one
Be a mystery cuz people ruin beautiful things.
